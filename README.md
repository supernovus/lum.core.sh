# lum.core.sh

Simple core libraries for writing Bash scripts.

## Description

Every time I wrote a CLI script, I was using completely different methods
for registering commands, displaying help info, and generally just doing
the basic stuff that most CLI scripts need to do.

This is an attempt to rectify that, by writing a core library like I have
for [JS](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.core.js) 
and [PHP](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.core.php).

## Requirements

- Bash 4.0 or higher
